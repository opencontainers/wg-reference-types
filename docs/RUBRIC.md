# Proposal Evaluation Rubric

This Rubric is based on the [user stories](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/blob/main/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md#user-stories) assembled by community members.

*WARNING* As discussed during the community meeting dated [March 1, 2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SVOWQTowigXzbYdorzfa7tMmrcm91yK12LvSONqziJY/edit#heading=h.qv9hc0gujvjj), this rubric is not meant to score the "best" proposal, but to evaluate what specific changes can be proposed to the OCI specifications.

The Rubric will be updated based on consensus reached in the community meetings.
