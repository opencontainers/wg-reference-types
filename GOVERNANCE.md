# Reference Types Working Group Governance

## Discussion

- Discussions take place on GitHub's [discussion board](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/discussions) and during [weekly meetings](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/blob/main/README.md#meetings).
- Notes taken during the community meetings are recorded in [this hackmd document](https://hackmd.io/bGIxKAxPROi8KlwZMQioXQ), and later migrated to the [minutes](./minutes) folder via pull request.

Discussions shall follow the [documented personas](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/blob/main/docs/PERSONAS.md) previously decided by this working group. Changes to the framework are encouraged via GitHub discussions, issues, and pull requests.

Working group members and maintainers shall follow the [OCI code of conduct](https://github.com/opencontainers/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Documentation

- Meeting minutes shall be published on this GitHub repository.
- A notetaker shall be identified to take notes during the meetings.
- The notetaker shall either transfer the notes to the GitHub repository or work with a maintainer to transfer notes.
- Notes for each day shall be recorded in markdown with the name of the form `yyyy-mm-dd.md` and submitted to the [minutes](./minutes) folder using a pull request.
- Consensus shall be documented in the form of GitHub issues that can be referenced in pull requests.

## Maintainer Operations

## Conflict Resolution
