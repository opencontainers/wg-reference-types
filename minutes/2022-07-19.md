Notes

- Issue 64 - artifactType
  - Concern that depending on the config descriptor media type will not work with Docker Hub (Brandon)
  - Consider specific use cases for Docker Hub (Michael)
  - Ask Docker Hub if they would consider changing their filtering on the Config media type
  - Brandon will update the PR based on comments and take out of draft state
- Issue 65 - predictable digest tags
  - Majority is in favor of predictable tags
  - We need to pick whether it is a tag per artifact type or one tag for all artifacts
  - One tag per type requires a query to recursively get all artifacts, but removes the search space for tools working with specific types of artifacts
  - Opening a follow on vote in [Issue 72](https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/issues/72)
  - There's still an option to roll back these changes before suggesting to OCI
- Reviewing PRs from Jamstah
  - Some may go away with the decision on 65
- Change sets to image-spec/dist-spec
  - distribution-spec has a sample PR by Josh
  - Nisha will start with the image-spec changes
  - To handle a migration with Go, it may require renames that would be handled with an alias. That may need a second repository rather than a rename. (Brandon)
